# Why do we need Ansible Playbooks?
In my previous article I demonstrated how we can use Ansible's ad hoc
commands to manage remote servers. You use ad hoc commands when we want to 
perform basic tasks in an efficient manner. But you can not always use them
to manage large and complex environments. Such as when you want to perform
end to end deployments on your infrastructure.

There comes Ansible playbooks which provides greater flexibility, easier to write and manage.
